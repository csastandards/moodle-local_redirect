# Requirements

This plugin requires Moodle 2.7+ from http://moodle.org .

It may work with previous versions of Moodle all the way back to Moodle 2.7 but it has not been tested yet. If it works for you, let us know. Tip: You might need to modify the version.php in order for Moodle to let you install it on earlier versions.

# Usage

To use this, simply create a link pointing to the plugin's folder and provide it with an encoded URL as the URL parameter. Example:

/local/redirect/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com%2Flogin%2Flogout.php%3Fsesskey%3D%7Bsesskey%7D

The plugin will replace 7Bsesskey%7D with the Moodle sesskey and then redirect to that URL.
